## About
ZKyNet VPN is a customized fork of [WG Tunnel](https://github.com/zaneschepke/wgtunnel) by Zane Schepke, modified to include ZKyNet server integration and management capabilities. This app combines the robust VPN functionality of WG Tunnel with custom server configuration management, supporting both [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) and [AmneziaWG](https://docs.amnezia.org/documentation/amnezia-wg/) protocols.

### Key ZKyNet Customizations
- Integrated ZKyNet server management via `ZKyNetVpnService`
- Per-server VPN toggles replacing default tunnel-adding flow
- Automatic config download and caching for production servers
- Custom UI with server selection interface
