ZKyNet VPN v1.0.0 - Founder's Edition

This is the early version — our foundation, not our final form.

What's Included:
• WireGuard and AmneziaWG protocol support
• Auto-tunneling based on network conditions
• Privacy-preserving architecture
• Open source MIT license

What's Coming:
We're building toward a hybrid zero-knowledge architecture that eliminates today's privacy trade-offs. This version establishes our technical credibility while we develop the differentiating features.

Join us as an early believer. Your feedback shapes what we build next.

Based on WG Tunnel by Zane Schepke.
