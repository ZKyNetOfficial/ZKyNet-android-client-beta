üöÄ FOUNDER'S EDITION - JOIN THE FIRST WAVE

This is just the start ‚Äî the version you see now is our foundation. We're building toward a privacy infrastructure that doesn't force compromises. If that's something you believe in, we'd love to have you as part of the first wave.

üì± WHAT THIS VERSION HAS:
‚Ä¢ WireGuard and AmneziaWG protocol support
‚Ä¢ Import your own custom VPN configurations
‚Ä¢ Auto-tunneling based on network conditions
‚Ä¢ One-tap connect/disconnect
‚Ä¢ Kill switch protection
‚Ä¢ No logging policy
‚Ä¢ 100% open source (MIT License)

üéØ WHAT WE'RE BUILDING TOWARD:
ZKyNet is developing a hybrid zero-knowledge architecture that strategically combines centralized and decentralized infrastructure. The goal: eliminate the trade-offs between privacy, speed, and usability that plague today's tools.

This current version proves we can build production-quality backend systems. The differentiating features are coming.

üí° WHY JOIN AS AN EARLY ADOPTER:
‚Ä¢ Help shape the roadmap with real feedback
‚Ä¢ Be part of the community that defines how privacy infrastructure should work
‚Ä¢ Support an open-source alternative that's transparent about where it is and where it's going

‚ö†Ô∏è TRANSPARENCY:
This version is missing features we're actively developing. It's not the finished product ‚Äî it's the foundation. We're launching now to build with believers, not to compete with established players yet.

If you care about privacy-preserving infrastructure and want to support its development, your early adoption is invaluable.
